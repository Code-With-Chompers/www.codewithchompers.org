# What is Software Testing?

::: incremental
- A way of validating and verifying your code works as intended
- A critical practice of software engineering
:::

## Why is Software Testing Important?

::: incremental
- Detect bugs early, before they become expensive
- Improve system design
- Support the ability to change
  - Quickly catch mistakes so you can make changes confidently
  - A robust testing system helps navigate changes
:::

## Automated vs. Manual Tests

::: incremental
- Manual Tests: 
  - Throwing sample data into a program to see if you get expected outcome
  - Slow and inefficient
  - More room for error
- Automated Tests:
  - Creating test cases that automatically test the functionality of your program
    - efficient
    - consistent
    - repeatable
:::

## Unit Testing

::: incremental
- tests with a narrow scope
  - tests a single class, method, or function
  - conceptually simple
- Unit tests are smaller and run frequently
- Easy to write alongside the tested code
- Promote test coverage
- MAINTAINABLE
:::

# Writing a unit test

::: incremental
- Function name: test_function
- assert statement
  - assertions are about ensuring 
  - `actual == expected`
  - only produce output when they are false
:::

## Sample function and tests

```python
# Sample function that squares a number
def square_integer(x):
    return x * x

# Test cases for square_integer
def test_square_positive():
    number = 2
    result = square_integer(number)
    assert result == 4

def test_square_negative():
    number = -2
    result = square_integer(number)
    assert result == 4

print(square_integer(2))
print(test_square_positive())
print(test_square_negative())
```
